        <h2> My <a href = "#" class = "background">Background</a> </h2>
        <p>I'm from Berkeley, CA but grew up all over the Bay Area in numerous cities.</p>
        <p>I went to Saint Mary's College in Moraga on a baseball scholarship and graduted with a degree in Physics.</p>
        <p>Also was able to pursue a career in professional baseball for a few years after getting drafted in 2014 in the 33rd round.</p> 
        <p>I've always had an interest in problem solving whether it was with different variants of math or science.</p>
        <p>My father was a science major,(Engineer), as well so I had a heavy influence from seeing most of his work he did at UC Berkeley.</p>
        <p>I'm hoping to have a similar impact as a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
